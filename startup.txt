⚠️ CONTENT WARNINGS & GAME MECHANICS (i-doll)
i-doll is an interactive drama intended for mature audiences. It explores the high-pressure, often predatory environment of the K-pop industry.  Due to the addition of new Psychological and Physical Realism mechanics, this story contains themes that may be distressing to some players.

🧠 Mental Health & Body Image Warnings
The narrative includes detailed depictions of:

Eating Disorders & Body Dysmorphia: The game simulates extreme weight standards, public weigh-ins, and the development of unhealthy coping mechanisms such as self-starvation.

Psychological Breakdown: The story tracks mental deterioration through states of Mania, Emotional Dissociation, and Severe Depression.


Physical Self-Harm: The abuse of medication (specifically high-strength painkillers) to force an injured body to continue performing. 

Institutional Abuse: Verbal and emotional abuse from authority figures and a rigid social hierarchy.

📊 Hidden Mechanics: Trauma & Mental States
Unlike the temporary Stress meter, which can be managed through rest, this game utilizes a permanent Trauma System:

Trauma Points: Extreme actions or traumatic events accrue hidden, permanent points that do not reset.

Mental State Flags: Once Trauma or Stress crosses specific thresholds, your character’s Mental State will shift based on their personality (e.g., a "Masked" character may dissociate, while a "Ruthless" character may enter a manic state).

Narrative Locking (Consequences): Having an active Eating Disorder or a compromised Mental State will permanently lock certain choices. Your character may become "too ill" or "too detached" to react in a healthy or social manner.

[!IMPORTANT] This game does not encourage or romanticize these behaviors. They are depicted as the destructive and harmful consequences of a brutal industry. Later chapters will offer opportunities to seek help and attempt recovery, though the path to healing is difficult and depends on your choices.

By clicking "Next," you acknowledge that you are aware of these themes and wish to proceed.

The red "ON AIR" light buzzes to life.
"The world knows the legend," the host says. "But where did it really begin?"

You close your eyes.
